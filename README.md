# Avalanche Weather Info

The idea behind this project is to produce a tool that can collate information
about avalanche conditions, weather conditions and predictions, for a given
location, and produce a pdf that can be printed or taken on a mobile device for
trips.

Also included in this project is the idea to produce topographical maps which
overlay avalanche forecast danger, and slope angle on top of topography. These
maps should be available in tile format for live viewing (using some kind of
tile map viewer client), and also in PDF.
